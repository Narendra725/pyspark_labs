# 🧭 Power BI | Microsoft Fabric | PySpark — Internal Learning Repository

This repository serves as a **central knowledge base** for my learnings and experiments related to **Power BI**, **Microsoft Fabric automations**, and **PySpark**.
It captures my **hands-on implementations**, **reusable scripts**, and **frameworks** developed while building end-to-end data solutions.

---

## 🔍 Objective

To consolidate technical learnings, automation utilities, and best practices that streamline the development and deployment of Power BI and Fabric-based data solutions.
The repository supports:

* Consistent and scalable **report development**.
* Automated **dataset and pipeline management** using Fabric.
* Efficient **data transformation and validation** through PySpark.

---

## ⚙️ Key Focus Areas

### 1. **Power BI**

* DAX optimization and performance tuning.
* Semantic model structuring and relationship design.
* Report standardization via JSON theme templates.
* Implementation of Top-N visuals, field parameters, and calculation groups.
* Dynamic filtering, context handling, and automation-ready models.

### 2. **Fabric Automations**

* API-based automation for dataset refreshes, report deployment, and validation.
* Orchestration of model refresh pipelines and event-triggered processes.
* Integration with Power Automate, DevOps, and Teams for workflow monitoring.
* Scripts to track refresh status, pipeline failures, and data drift across environments.

### 3. **PySpark**

* Data ingestion, transformation, and aggregation using Spark DataFrames.
* Interfacing with Fabric Lakehouse and Delta tables.
* Validation and pre-processing pipelines prior to Power BI consumption.
* Performance optimization techniques and job orchestration patterns.

* Continuous performance benchmarking for DAX and Spark workloads.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Usage Guidelines

* All code, measures, and notebooks are **for internal use and learning purposes**.
* Follow naming conventions and directory structure when adding new content.
* Use dedicated branches for experimental work before merging to main.
* Maintain version control for JSON themes, DAX libraries, and pipeline scripts.

---

## 🧠 Contributor Notes

* Contributions should include a brief README or markdown note explaining:

  * Purpose of the script or notebook.
  * Inputs, outputs, and dependencies.
  * Known issues or limitations.
* Peer review is recommended before merging to the main branch.
